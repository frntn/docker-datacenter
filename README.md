  * `DTR` or `Docker Trusted Registry`: offers on-premise image management and storage
  * `UCP` or `Universal Control Plane`: offers on-premise docker applications management

Both requires a CS subscription _(**C**ommercial **S**upport)_

## Usage

*Note1: if you want __unattended install__ you must specify your network interface in 
`Vagrantfile`->`config.vm.network`. On linux, you can extract this information
using this command : `ip -o -4 route get 8.8.8.8 | cut -f5 -d' '`*

*Note2: I strongly recommend the usage of __vagrant cachier__ plugin 
[more info](vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier)*

### A. Docker Trusted Registry

#### A1. start your DTR

```bash
./start.sh dtr   # <-- approx 25min (with a decent 1Mo/s internet connection)
```

This will :

1. Destroy previously created DTR vm (if any)
2. Spin up the `registry` vm
4. Start the demo script from within the vm

Now you just have to setup your UCP instance and you're ready to go

#### A2. configure the service

**Get** DTR dashboard url

```bash
./dashboard.sh dtr
```

**Open** your browser to the given url (the certificate is not trusted so 
you have to accept the *insecure* connection. That's the expected behavior).

**Set** the domain name to `registry.docker.local` in `Settings`->`general` 
(Don't forget to hit `save and restart` at the bottom of the page)

![registry-editdomain](img/registry-editdomain.png?raw=true)

**Upload** your license in `Settings`->`License`

![registry-addlicense](img/registry-addlicense.png?raw=true)

**Create** an admin user in `Settings`->`Auth`
(if you want to use the demo script below, you'll need to create the following 
username/password : `frntn`/`demopass`)

![registry-adduser](img/registry-adduser.png?raw=true)

And finally **create** an `organisation` and a `repository` inside that organisation.
(if you want to use the demo script below, you'll need to create the following 
orgnisation/repository : `ci-infra`/`myjenkins`)

*Now you might still have red box warning about docker engine incompatibility.
That's not a problem: Just a version checking bug on `1.4.2` which is the latest
at the time of writing.*

#### A3. launch demo

**Start** the demo script to see the DTR in action

```bash
./start.sh dtr_demo   # <-- approx 15min (with a decent 1Mo/s internet connection)
```

This will :

1. *build* a custom jenkins from official image
2. *push* the custom image on the DTR
3. *run* a container pulled from that remote image stored on the DTR

Congratulations ! :)
You can now open the dashboard of your custom Jenkins instance.

### B. Universal Control Plane

#### B1. start your UCP cluster

```bash
./start.sh ucp
```

This will :

1. Destroy previously created UCP vms (if any)
2. Spin up the master `controller` vm
3. Spin up the replicas `node1` and `node2` vm
4. Configure multi-host networking

Now you just have to setup your UCP instance and you're ready to go

#### B2. configure the service

**Get** UCP dashboard url

```bash
./dashboard.sh ucp
```

**Open** your browser to the given url (the certificate is not trusted so 
you have to accept the *insecure* connection. That's the expected behavior).

**Connect** using defaults `admin`/`orca` 

**Upload** your license in the settings page

![controller-addlicense](img/controller-addlicense.png?raw=true)

**Change** the default passowrd in the profile page 

![controller-editprofile](img/controller-editprofile.png?raw=true)

#### B3. launch demo

We now want to use the docker client against the UCP cluster :

```bash
cd ucp/bundle/
source env.sh  # <-- your docker client now speaks with your "remote" UCP cluster
docker version #Â <-- the 'server:' now mentions 'ucp/0.8.0'
```

We can now spinup the demo application :

```bash
cd ucp/application
docker-compose up -d
```

Congratulations ! :)
Back to the UCP dashboard you can see the newly deployed application :
